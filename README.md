#JavaScript Widgets

Various small, client-side apps written in object-oriented model-view-controller JavaScript. I did my best to modularize and completely decouple my code from itself.

I'm currently using jQuery, and a third party CSS normalize that I am mostly unhappy with. I am considering replacing both with custom libraries in the future. 

Confirmed browser compatibility with Google Chrome v. 36.0.1985.125, Mozilla Firefox v. 30.0, and Safari v. 7.0.5.
